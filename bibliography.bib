              auto-regressive models",
  author   = "Lee, Duncan and Mitchell, Richard",
  abstract = "Conditional auto-regressive models are commonly used to capture
              spatial cor relation in areal unit data, as part of a
              hierarchical Bayesian model. The spatial correlation structure
              that is induced by these models is determined by geographical
              adjacency, but this is too simplistic for some real data sets,
              which can visually exhibit subregions of strong correlation as
              well as locations at which the response exhibits a step change.
              An example of this, and the motivation for the paper, is the
              spatial pattern in respiratory disease risk in the 271 intermed
              iate geographies in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board in
              2005. The methodology proposed is an extension to the class of
              conditional auto-regressive priors, which allow them to capture
              such localized spatial correlation and to identify step changes.
              The approach takes the form of an iterative algorithm, which
              sequentially updates the spatial correlation structure that is
              assumed by the model in addition to estimating the remaining
              parameters. The efficacy of the approach is assessed by
              simulation, before being applied to the motivating Greater
              Glasgow application.",

  abstract  = "The Wiley Classics Library consists of selected books that have
               been made more accessible to consumers in an effort to increase
               global appeal and general circulation. With these new unabridged
               softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these
               works by making them available to future generations of
               statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial
               statistics --- analyzing spatial data through statistical models
               --- has proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems
               ranging from the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the
               scientist and engineer faced only with scattered and uneven
               treatments of the subject in the scientific literature, learning
               how to make practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day
               analytical work is very difficult. Designed exclusively for
               scientists eager to tap into the enormous potential of this
               analytical tool and upgrade their range of technical skills,
               Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive, single-source
               guide to both the theory and applied aspects of spatial
               statistical methods. The hard-cover edition was hailed by
               Mathematical Reviews as an ``excellent book which will become a
               basic reference.'' This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition,
               is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the
               scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of
               geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book
               sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how
               design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that
               link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial
               statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a
               host of areas in science and engineering. Discussion includes:
               Exploratory spatial data analysis Spectral theory for stationary
               processes Spatial scale Simulation methods for spatial processes
               Spatial bootstrapping Statistical image analysis and remote
               sensing Computational aspects of model fitting Application of
               models to disease mapping Designed to accommodate the practical
               needs of the professional, it features a unified and common
               notation for its subject as well as many detailed examples woven
               into the text, numerous illustrations (including graphs that
               illuminate the theory discussed) and over 1,000 references.
               Fully balancing theory with applications, Statistics for Spatial
               Data, Revised Edition is an exceptionally clear guide on making
               optimal use of one of the ascendant analytical tools of the
               decade, one that has begun to capture the imagination of
               professionals in biology, earth science, civil, electrical, and
               agricultural engineering, geography, epidemiology, and ecology.",

  title     = "Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood in {Model-Based} Geostatistics",
  author    = "Christensen, Ole F",
  abstract  = "When using a model-based approach to geostatistical problems,
               often, due to the complexity of the models, inference relies on
               Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. This article focuses on the
               generalized linear spatial models, and demonstrates that
               parameter estimation and model selection using Markov chain
               Monte Carlo maximum likelihood is a feasible and very useful
               technique. A dataset of radionuclide concentrations on Rongelap
               Island is used to illustrate the techniques. For this dataset we
               demonstrate that the log-link function is not a good choice, and
               that there exists additional nonspatial variation which cannot
               be attributed to the Poisson error distribution. We also show
               that the interpretation of this additional variation as either
               micro-scale variation or measurement error has a significant
               impact on predictions. The techniques presented in this article
               would also be useful for other types of geostatistical models.",
